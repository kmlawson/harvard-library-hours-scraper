# Harvard Library Hours Scraper

This scraper for the Harvard Library Hours no longer works, I'm afraid. The new hours page for this year uses a more complex markup for the display of hours. The script could be modified to fit the new hours page but I suggest that anyone who does so shifts from a simple regular expression approach to using a more robust sraping engine such as Mechanize for Ruby or Beautiful Soup for Python, or even better some PHP equivalent for minimum change to the code.
